Jet streams and golden dawns. Pod sounds echoing June. Conch shells molesting deserted beaches. Paranoia strikes: what about the toxic dry cleaners? or: plastics too many. It’s got longevity when adrift at sea, how full is moon two tonight?

Maybe moon two isn’t real. Maybe we didn’t shoot all our trash into space where Newton orchestrated a second orbital sphere.

Ahab it seems is still screaming at us. The whales jump.

Suspense as we watch abnormal acceleration. (Depending on the inputs you use for cross sectional area and drag coefficient a whale has a terminal velocity somewhere in the neighborhood of 700 - 2000 meters per second.)

We all gasp. Wonder why they jumped. Why they left us. Why did they go. We all know the answer, deep inside.

The pain of seeing the last whales is too much for an old woman to my left. She wails hysterically;daughter burying face in her bosom. It’s beautiful the way whale blubber flaps in the air.

Cheeks stretched like a dogs with head out the car window. Yet the benefits of fins and tails are not lost in this free fall.

{(poorly timed joke: what is the sound of a whale in free fall?) [hands clapping]}

Seconds pass slowly at first and then it seems time accelerates. Once massive shapes recede to points past clouds. Colors Blur. At once the points grow, the eyes immediately yell trick.

But we didn’t know the whales had parachutes on. They may not be dead, yet they are still gone.
