Digital ruminations.    
Collections.   
Thoughts.  
Theories, both sound or otherwise.  
Whispers.  
Contemplations and conundrums.  Misunderstandings a sublime synchronicity.  

<span class="newthought">The collected (condensed) works</span> of Kyle Cunningham, painter and desert dweller.  Printmaker and purveyor of handcrafted adornment. Notes and rumination upon various subjects pertaining and not pertaining to his own creations.  This is a collection of established quips and visual cues accompanied.

Slowly progressing in fits and starts, the proverbial under constuction with daily updates.  Building a website is hard for me, much harder then putting brush to canvas.  Come back and poke around and you will be rewarded with a collection of my thoughts, creations, motivations, ideas, desires and actions in life.</span>
